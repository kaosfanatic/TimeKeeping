==TimeKeeping, the Readme==

The purpose of this program is to allow me to better keep track of my hours worked while working from home.  While I'm sure there are many programs out there for this, I figured I'd challenge myself to make my own.


TODO: Â format record to include day of week, day of month, month, and year.

Related project: database system, just for fun.
